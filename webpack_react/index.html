Back in the day it was enough to understand how Makefiles work. That said even today Make is a viable tool. During the past few years we have seen many new tools come and go especially in the realm of frontend development. First Grunt became popular. Shortly after that Gulp gained momentum. These t…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="webpack_compared">webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
To understand webpack, it will help to look at the history. That will put the tool in context and show you why the approach is powerful. Back in the day we were happy just to concat some scripts together but that won&#x27;t do anymore. JavaScript libraries can be very large these days and nobody likes t…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="getting_started">Getting Started</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/02_getting_started" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
If you are not one of those guys that likes to skip introductions, you might have some clue what webpack is. In its simplicity it is a module bundler. It takes a bunch of assets in and outputs assets you can give to your client.

This sounds very simple but in practice it can be a very complicated …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="developing_with_webpack">Developing with webpack</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/03_developing_with_webpack" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
In Getting Started we set up a minimal webpack based build. Hitting npm run build all the time will get boring eventually. In addition refreshing browser manually is annoying. We can get rid of both of these problems if we do a bit more configuration work.

Facebook&#x27;s React is one of those projects that has changed the way we think about frontend development. Thanks to React Native the approach isn&#x27;t limited just to web. Although simple to learn, React provides plenty of power.

Given we have a nice development setup now, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude Note List with basic manipulation operations. We will start by doing things the hard way. We will grow our application from scratch and get into some trouble. After that you shoul…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="react_and_flux">React and Flux</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/06_react_and_flux" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Flux application architecture helps to bring clarity to our React applications. You can get quite far by keeping everything in components but eventually that will become painful. Flux provides one way out of this.

In this chapter we will be using Alt, a light Flux implementation. It gets rid of a …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="from_notes_to_kanban">From Notes to Kanban</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/07_from_notes_to_kanban" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">

So far we have managed to set up a nice little development environment and develop an application for keeping track of notes in localStorage. We still have work to do in order to turn this into a real Kanban as pictured above.

Most importantly our system is missing the concept of Lane. A Lane is …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="styling_react">Styling React</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/08_styling_react" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Traditionally web pages have been split up in markup (e.g. HTML), styling (e.g. CSS) and logic (e.g. JavaScript). Even though this sounds simple in practice there are overlaps. You might trigger CSS animations through JavaScript. As seen earlier React provides a component oriented way of developmen…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="implementing_dnd">Implementing Drag and Drop</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/09_implementing_dnd" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It doesn&#x27;t look that bad and there&#x27;s some basic functionality in place. In this chapter I&#x27;ll show you how to take it to the next level. We will integrate some drag and drop functionality as we set up React DnD. After this chapter you should be able to so…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="linting_in_webpack">Linting in webpack</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/10_linting_in_webpack" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Nothing is easier than making mistakes when coding in JavaScript. Linting is one of those techniques that can help you to make less mistakes and spot issues before they become actual problems.

Perhaps the most known linter that started it all for JavaScript is Douglas Crockford&#x27;s JSLint. It is opi…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="deploying_applications">Deploying Applications</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
If you were developing a native application you would probably bundle everything into one file and deploy it to some application store. Size probably wouldn&#x27;t matter that much. Web is different. You can get quite far with a single bundle but at a certain point that becomes unwieldy.

npm is one of the reasons behind the popularity of Node.js. It has become the package manager for JavaScript. Although initially it was used mostly for managing backend packages, it has become increasingly popular in frontend development.
