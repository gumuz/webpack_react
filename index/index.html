<p>Facebook&apos;s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a>, a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.</p>
<p><em>SurviveJS - Webpack and React</em> shows you how to build a simple Kanban application based on these technologies. During the process you will learn at least the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>To set up a Webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader">react-hot-loader</a> for development.</li>
<li>To improve the quality of your code by using <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> and spot possible mistakes earlier.</li>
<li>To use <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> to unlock the future features of JavaScript now.</li>
<li>To understand the basics of React and get into the mindset. Even though React is conceptually simple, it has to &quot;click&quot; in order to become powerful.</li>
<li>To learn the basics of <a href="http://alt.js.org/">Alt</a>, an implementation of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux Application Architecture</a>. Flux complements React well.</li>
<li>To move beyond TODO application level and into application design and architecture.</li>
<li>To style your React application in various emerging ways.</li>
<li>To implement drag and drop for your application using <a href="https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/">React DnD</a></li>
<li>To deploy your application into production environment using various deployment strategies.</li>
<li>To author developer friendly JavaScript libraries for other developers to consume.</li>
</ol>

<p>I expect you know the basics of JavaScript but beyond that not much is needed. You just need to have patience to work through the book and poke me in case there&apos;s something you don&apos;t understand!</p>

I, <a href="https://twitter.com/bebraw">Juho Veps&#xE4;l&#xE4;inen</a>, have been dealing with the web one way or another since the 90s. All hail <em>marquee</em>! I&apos;ve seen the rise of web and JavaScript in particular. Besides React I have extensive experience in Angular, jQuery and various smaller libraries (mapping, charts, whatnot).
