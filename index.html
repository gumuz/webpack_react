Technology keeps on improving all the time and it can be difficult to keep up. That is where SurviveJS comes in.</p><p>The first book of the series focuses on Webpack and React. Webpack, a module bundler, solves the fundamental problem of frontend development. In the end you will want to package a bunch of various assets into something for client to consume. Webpack can do that with ease.</p><p>Facebook&#x27;s React is another one of those tools that simplifies the life of web developers greatly. Although it is just a library focusing on rendering views it has changed the way we think about frontend development.</p><p>Combined these two technologies provide an excellent starting point for modern web application development.</p><h3>Why?</h3><p>SurviveJS - Webpack and React is a book I wish I had when I bumped into these technologies for the first time. I would have saved a lot of time and headache. But worry not. You don&#x27;t have to be as unlucky.</p><p>I have distilled my knowledge about the topic in this book in an easy to follow format. Following the book you will build a simplistic Kanban application that can be used for tracking tasks. When ready you can even you use it with your own projects.</p><p>As I am aware just following along can be boring I have set up the project in its various steps in the accompanying GitHub repository. The book isn&#x27;t entirely tutorial-driven. Some parts provide you more general view of the scene. For instance I discuss topics such as styling and library authorship in greater detail.</p><h3>When?</h3><p>An early version of the book is already available. I keep track of the status of the book in <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react#progress">the project README</a>. Especially early chapters and a couple of the later ones are in a good condition. Feedback is very welcome.</p><p>Even though the book is free under CC BY-NC-ND license, financial support is welcome. You can for instance purchase <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack">an electronic copy of the book</a>.</p></div></div><noscript></noscript><noscript></noscript></main></div></body></html>
